This was an assingment where you need to crate a game of hangman using only javascript, HTML, bootstrap, and CSS.
# Offical instructions
Create a hangman game that uses the provided phrases to play a 1 player
game
• The phrase should be randomly selected from the list of phrases when a
new game is started
• The player will guess letters until one of those following happens:
o The word or phrase is completely filled in
o The player correctly guesses the word or phrase (provide an option
for guessing the puzzle)
o The player exhausts the number of incorrect guesses
▪ The maximum number of incorrect guesses is 6
▪ Visually that is HEAD, BODY, ARM, ARM, LEG, LEG
▪ Display the appropriate image for each incorrect guess
• Correct guesses should be properly displayed in the puzzle area
• Incorrect guesses should also be displayed on the game board
• Do not allow the same letter to be guessed more than once
• Appropriate messages should be displayed depending on the game’s
outcome
• The player should be allowed to choose to play another game or exit the
application
• Use CSS to make the game both visually appealing and easy to read
• Use comments to internally document your code
• Excessive use of code copied from the internet or other students will result
in loss of points – this is an exercise in creating a JavaScript web application,
start to finish
